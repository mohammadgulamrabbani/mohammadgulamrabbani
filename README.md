## Hi there 👋 

## Who Am I?

🌟 I’m Mohammad Gulam Rabbani, an aspiring AI & Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that go beyond simple automation. My focus is on creating AI that is more human-centered, spontaneous, and deeply integrated with daily life.


## My Vision: 

Traditional AI works in a reactive way — you ask, and it responds.

But what happens if AI can capture spontaneous thoughts, track patterns, and build a personal life-history model of its user.

Think of it as a second brain 🧠 — one that remembers, reflects, and helps you connect ideas you might otherwise forget. That's sounds Roaring 🚀 right!


## What I Work On:

Exploring Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

Designing experimental AI models that simulate memory and recursion.

Explore AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity to accelerate ideation and prototyping.


## Why I Build in Public:

I believe in sharing progress, not just results. By documenting experiments and ideas, I open the door to feedback, collaboration, and innovation with the global AI community.


## Future Goals:

Push the boundaries of personalized AI systems.

Contribute to the global AI revolution with solutions that truly serve humanity.
